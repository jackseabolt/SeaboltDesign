	<h3>Background</h3>
	<br />
	<p>Having grown up next to Silicon Valley, I always had a deep interest in computers. However, I began my career in legal marketing. In 2011, I graduated from the University of Oregon with a B.A. in Advertising from the School of Journalism and Communications. Out of college, I got a position at a local law firm, working with information databases. This soon lead to a second job working as the Marketing Manager for a small, boutique firm in San Francisco. Over the next few years, I worked with several law firms, coding HTML newsletters and orgnanizing legal seminars. In 2016, I founded Seabolt Design.</p>
