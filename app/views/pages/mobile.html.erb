	<h3>Mobile Design</h3>
	<hr>
	<p>Did you know that 43% of consumers check their mobile phones within five minutes of waking up? In fact, according to Gallup, 72% of U.S. smartphone users check their phone at least hourly throughout their day. And according to the same survey, 52% of the American population report checking their phone multiple times an <i>hour</i>. 
	<br /><br />
	These are numbers that should stop any intelligent marketer in his or her tracks. Although mobile media is a relatively new phenomenon, it has grown to dominate the modern marketplace. Amazon reported in 2015 that over <strong>70% of their holiday business</strong> was done through mobile devices. To reach customers effectively in the modern economy, a business must have a strong mobile presence.

With my help, we can harness your business's potential with a mobile-friendly site that will help you connect with new markets and stay in touch with your existing customers so they keep coming back.</p>
